# Prerequisites
In this section, we will cover installing:
- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional)
- Build tools for your OS

Before getting started with Millennium, you should have at least a basic understanding of Rust and HTML/CSS/JS.

<h2>Installing Visual Studio Build Tools</h2>

Visual Studio Build Tools is required to build some C++ dependencies. We recommend [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe). When asked which workloads to install, ensure "Desktop development with C++" is selected. On the right side, under Installation details, ensure "MSVC C++ x64/x86 build tools" and a Windows 10/11 SDK are selected.

<h2>Installing Rust</h2>

You can use <a href="https://rustup.rs" target="_blank">Rustup</a> to manage your Rust installation. Download the installer [here](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64) and follow the on-screen instructions to install Rust.

If you plan to do your development in Rust, you should install the `default` profile. If you will be using Millennium from another language via bindings, you can install the `minimal` profile for a lighter install.

<h2>Installing Node.js (optional)</h2>

We can use Node.js to install the Millennium CLI tool. You may already have or will be using Node.js to build your application's assets. We recommend [Node.js 16.14.2 LTS](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.14.2/node-v16.14.2-x64.msi), but any version over Node.js 10 will do.

**You shouldn't install the C++ build tools if prompted**, since we already installed them in the first step; you may encounter issues if you have multiple build tools versions installed.

You can install the Millennium CLI without Node.js, but keep in mind when following these articles to use the Cargo commands instead of the npm commands.

<h2>Installing Edge WebView2</h2>

WebView2 is used by Millennium to render the frontend of your application. **WebView2 is pre-installed on Windows 11**, so if you are running Windows 11, you can skip this section. For older versions of Windows, you can install it via Microsoft's <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section" target="_blank">Evergreen Bootstrapper</a>.

End-users of your application will not have to install WebView2 manually if you use `millennium-bundler`, it will automatically install WebView2.

<hr />

After installing Rust and Node.js, you should restart your terminal (or in some cases, your PC) to ensure the PATH updates. Run `rustc --version` and `node --version` to ensure the dependencies installed successfully.

<h2>Installing build tools &amp; dependencies</h2>

You will need to install a C/C++ build environment and webkit2gtk. Below are the installation commands for a few popular Linux distributions:

<Tabs groupId="linux-flavour">
<TabItem value="debian" label="Ubuntu/Debian" default>

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev build-essential curl wget libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev \
    libappindicator3-dev \ # optional - required for system tray
    librsvg2-dev # optional - required for building AppImages
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="arch" label="Arch Linux">

```bash
$ sudo pacman -Syu
$ sudo pacman -S --needed webkit2gtk base-devel curl wget openssl appmenu-gtk-module gtk3 libvips \
    libappindicator-gtk3 \ # optional - required for system tray
    librsvg # optional - required for building AppImages
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fedora" label="Fedora">

```bash
$ sudo dnf check-update
$ sudo dnf group install "C Development Tools and Libraries"
$ sudo dnf install webkit2gtk3-devel.x86_64 openssl-devel curl wget \
    libappindicator-gtk3 \ # optional - required for system tray
    librsvg2-devel # optional - required for building AppImages
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<h2>Installing Node.js</h2>

We can use Node.js to install the Millennium CLI tool. You may already have or will be using Node.js to build your application's assets. We recommend using `nvm` to manage your Node.js installation. Install it with the following bash script:

```bash
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Close and re-open your terminal and install the latest LTS version of Node:

```bash
$ nvm install node --lts --latest-npm
$ nvm use node
```

If you have any problems with nvm, check nvm's [readme](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

<h2>Installing Rust</h2>

The following command installs [Rustup](https://rustup.rs), the official Rust installer/version manager.

```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the rustup tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted for your password. If the installation was successful, the following line will appear:

```
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

<hr />

After installing Rust and Node.js, you should restart your terminal (or in some cases, your PC) to ensure the PATH updates. Run `rustc --version` and `node --version` to ensure the dependencies installed successfully.

<h2>Install Xcode</h2>

Install Xcode Command Line Tools with `xcode-select`:

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
```

<h2>Installing Node.js</h2>

We can use Node.js to install the Millennium CLI tool. You may already have or will be using Node.js to build your application's assets. We recommend using `nvm` to manage your Node.js installation. Install it with the following bash script:

```bash
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

Close and re-open your terminal and install the latest LTS version of Node:

```bash
$ nvm install node --lts --latest-npm
$ nvm use node
```

<h2>Installing Rust</h2>

The following command installs [Rustup](https://rustup.rs), the official Rust installer/version manager.

```bash
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

## Managing the Rust installation
You should keep your Rust version up to date whenever possible to benefit from the latest features & performance improvements. Millennium also takes advantage some relatively recent Rust features, so not keeping your Rust up to date may result in compilation errors. To update Rust, open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ rustup update
```

This will update both `rustup` and the Rust compiler. You should also close your IDE before updating Rust to avoid issues.

## Troubleshooting
When running `rustc --version`, you should get a message like the following:
```
rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)
```

If the command does not suceed, consult [Rust's troubleshooting guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html#troubleshooting) to fix it. You can also get help from [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/BAkXJ6VjCz) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pykeio/millennium/discussions).
