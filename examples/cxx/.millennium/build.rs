//! This script uses millennium-bindings-cxx to generate C++ bindings for Millennium based on patterns analyzed from
//! your C++ code. You shouldn't have to modify any of the logic in here, Millennium will do that for you. Just modify
//! the settings below to match your project setup.
//!
//! The generated C/C++ header file is included in the `target` folder relative to the `build.rs` file. The generated
//! libraries (both static and shared) are included in the `target/{config}` folder relative to the `build.rs` file,
//! where {config} is the Rust target configuration (`debug` or `release`).
//!
//! This crate can be cross-compiled:
//! ```bash
//! $ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
//! $ rustup toolchain install stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
//! $ cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
//! ```
//!
//! To build a release build (with size optimizations), run `cargo build --release`.
//!
//! On Windows, you need to link to the following libraries (if you are not using the CMake script):
//! ```plaintext
//! user32.lib kernel32.lib gdi32.lib shell32.lib advapi32.lib bcrypt.lib ws2_32.lib imm32.lib userenv.lib oleaut32.lib
//! dwmapi.lib comctl32.lib uxtheme.lib WebView2LoaderStatic.lib
//! ```
//!
//! WebView2LoaderStatic.lib can be found in the `Microsoft.Web.WebView2` NuGet package, which you can download
//! at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Web.WebView2/. The library is found under `build/native/{arch}/`, and
//! you can use 7-Zip to extract it from the nupkg file.

/// The path to your .millenniumrc config file relative to the `build.rs` file. For most projects, this is
/// `../.millenniumrc`. Note that these bindings do **not** support platform-specific configuration files. If you need
/// conditional configuration for platforms, you can use something like the following:
///
/// ```rust
/// #[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
/// pub const MILLENNIUMRC_PATH: &str = "../.millenniumrc.macos";
/// #[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
/// pub const MILLENNIUMRC_PATH: &str = "../.millenniumrc.linux";
/// #[cfg(target_os = "windows")]
/// pub const MILLENNIUMRC_PATH: &str = "../.millenniumrc.windows";
/// ```
pub const MILLENNIUM_CONFIG_PATH: &str = "../Millennium.toml";
/// The path(s) to your C/C++ source code relative to the `build.rs` file.
/// This will be scanned by millennium-bindings-cxx to generate bindings.
/// In Rust, commands (among other things) are generated at compile time using Rust macros. Because we have to build the
/// Rust library before building C++, we have to scan the C++ beforehand to see what commands are being registered. The
/// C++ parsing is not at all perfect and is not context-aware, so be careful when using macro patterns and
/// use them with proper whitespace and don't use them in comments.
