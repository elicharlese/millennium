Millennium is a cross-platform webview framework written in Rust. With Millennium, you can design consistent UI that works across all platforms, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it works
Millennium leverages the webview API pre-installed on modern desktop & mobile operating systems for smaller, faster applications compared to Electron or NW.js. With Millennium's JavaScript API, you can interact with native Rust code and perform system-level operations, including reading/writing files & networking. A simple Millennium app can be less than **10 MB** in size and can be reduced further to less than **2 MB**. Millennium apps can launch almost twice as fast as equivalent Electron applications and use as little as __1/4 of the amount of RAM.__

Millennium is a fork of [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [`tao`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/), [`wry`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), and some official plugins, with a few added features and changes âœ¨

## The `millennium-runtime-webview` crate
This crate opens up direct systems-level interactions specifically for Millennium Webview, such as printing, monitor detection, and other windowing-related tasks. It's a `millennium-runtime` implementation for Millennium Webview.
