Millennium is a cross-platform webview framework written in Rust. With Millennium, you can design consistent UI that works across all platforms, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it works
Millennium leverages the webview API pre-installed on modern desktop & mobile operating systems for smaller, faster applications compared to Electron or NW.js. With Millennium's JavaScript API, you can interact with native Rust code and perform system-level operations, including reading/writing files & networking. A simple Millennium app can be less than **10 MB** in size and can be reduced further to less than **2 MB**. Millennium apps can launch almost twice as fast as equivalent Electron applications and use as little as __1/4 of the amount of RAM.__

Millennium is a fork of [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [`tao`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/), [`wry`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), and some official plugins, with a few added features and changes âœ¨

## `@pyke/millennium-api`
This package provides the JavaScript API for [Millennium](https://millennium.pyke.io/) applications. With `@pyke/millennium-api`, you can create windows, execute processes, read files, and more from JavaScript with APIs similar to (but not 100% compatible with) Node.js.

You can also access the Millennium API without this module via `window.Millennium` if `build > withGlobalMillennium` is enabled in your Millennium config file. We highly recommend that you bundle this module with your frontend code for production apps for security.
